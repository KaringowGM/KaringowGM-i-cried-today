I Cried Today is a digital sanctuary designed to provide a breathing space in a fast-paced world. Part of the Crown of Insight ecosystem, this web application aims to normalize emotional expression through a soothing "Royal Light" interface. Developed as a Single Page Application (SPA) using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, it features a responsive design, multi-language support (English, French, and Arabic), and an interactive chat. This project reflects my journey in "Deep Work" and programming, blending technical rigor with a human-centered approach to mental well-being.
